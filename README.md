## Usage
Once viewing the website, you can enter any movie into the input and press "Action!" Once that information is submitted, two server-side APIs are called upon to retrieve not only information about that movie, but also to pick a drink by its associated genre to accommodate your movie. 

The drink name, photo, ingredients and instructions for preparation are all generated for a user. Once you click the 'Favorite' checkbox, that drink will be saved for future reference.
